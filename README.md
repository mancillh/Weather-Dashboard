Built With HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS

# Usage
The user is provided a weather dashboard with a search bar. When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city (a 5-day forecast including the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed) and that city is added to a clickable search history. When the user clicks on a city in their search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
